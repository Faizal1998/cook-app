            Creating social media posts is a great way to hone your content writing skills. Since posts are typically very short, snappy, and quick, you can easily try out different styles of writing and see what people respond to. It’s easy to change direction and adapt if you need to tweak your writing style since social media posts are typically fluid and changeable by nature. You can also practice A/B testing with your social media ads—try writing two different posts and sending it to similar demographics and see which one performs better.
